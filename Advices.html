        <h2>Wash your hands frequently</h2>
        <p>
          Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand
          rub or wash them with soap and water.
        </p>
        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>
          Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub
          kills viruses that may be on your hands.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="Advice">
        <h2>Maintain social distancing</h2>
        <p>
          Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and
          anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
        </p>
        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>
          When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from
          their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you
          can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the
          person coughing has the disease.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="Advice">
        <h2>Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth</h2>

        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>
          Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated,
          hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there,
          the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="Advice">
        <h2>Practice respiratory hygiene</h2>
        <p>
          Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory
          hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow
          or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue
          immediately.
        </p>
        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>
          Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you
          protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and
          COVID-19.

        <h2>
          If you have symptoms seek medical care early
        </h2>
        <p>
          Stay home if you feel unwell. If you symptoms seek medical attention
          and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health
          authority.
        </p>
        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>
          Authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation
          in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider
          to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also
          protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.

        <h2>

          given by your healthcare provider on how to protect yourself and
          others from COVID-19.
        </p>
        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>
          National and local authorities will have the most up to date
          information on whether COVID-19 is spreading in your area. They are
          best placed to advise on what people in your area should be doing to
          protect themselves.
